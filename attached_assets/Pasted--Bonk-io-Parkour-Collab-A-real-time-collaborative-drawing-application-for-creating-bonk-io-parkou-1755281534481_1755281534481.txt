# Bonk.io Parkour Collab

A real-time collaborative drawing application for creating bonk.io parkour maps. Multiple users can join a lobby, draw lines together on a shared canvas, and export the map data for use in bonk.io.

## Features

- Real-time collaborative drawing
- Multiple line types (bouncy, death, non-bouncy)
- Live chat system
- Map size adjustment
- Copy map data for bonk.io integration
- Responsive design

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bonkio-parkour-collab.git
cd bonkio-parkour-collab
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Development

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server with nodemon for automatic restarts on file changes.

## Production Build & Deployment

### Building the Application

```bash
npm run build
```

Note: This application doesn't require a separate build step as it serves static files directly. The build command is available for compatibility with deployment scripts.

### Starting the Application

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server on the configured port (default: 3000).

### Environment Variables

- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)

### Production Deployment

1. Clone the repository on your server
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set environment variables if needed
4. Start the application: `npm start`

For production use with PM2 (process manager):

```bash
# Install PM2 globally
npm install -g pm2

# Start the application
pm2 start index.js --name "bonkio-parkour-collab"

# Save PM2 configuration
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

### Deployment Script Example

Here's a sample deployment script similar to what your host mentioned:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

cd /path/to/your/app

echo "==> Pulling latest commit"
git pull --ff-only

echo "==> Installing/updating dependencies"
npm install --production

echo "==> Restarting application"
pm2 reload bonkio-parkour-collab || pm2 start index.js --name bonkio-parkour-collab

echo "==> Deployment complete"
pm2 logs bonkio-parkour-collab --lines 50
```

```

## How It Works

1. **Server**: Node.js with Express serves static files and handles WebSocket connections via Socket.IO
2. **Client**: Vanilla JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas for real-time collaborative drawing
3. **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO enables real-time synchronization between clients
4. **Game Logic**: Server manages game state, player actions, and broadcasts updates to all connected clients

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Serves the main application
- WebSocket events handled via Socket.IO for real-time features

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with HTML5 Canvas and WebSocket support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (recent versions)
